## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Provides the `fixturevault` .NET tool for read-only auditing of snapshot and golden files without changing fixture contents.
- Supports Verify, Snapshooter, generic golden-file, manifest-backed orphan, portability, size, binary, sensitive-data, and path-policy checks with stable JSON output and CI exit codes.
- Creates `.fixturevault.json` through `fixturevault init` only when the policy file is absent, and preserves existing policy and fixture files.
- Requires `ci.strict` to be an explicit Boolean: `true` blocks findings, `false` reports warnings, and missing or invalid values fail with exit code `2`.
- Handles accepted Verify binary baselines and configured binary extensions without text decoding, while reporting received or unexpected binary assets according to the fixture policy.
- Uses fail-closed sensitive-data configuration and limits repository-root fallback scans to supported fixture-shaped files; ordinary repository binaries remain outside the governed fixture set.
